        <h1>Introduction</h1></center>
                <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marine life, sea life, or ocean life is the plants, animals and other organisms that live in the salt 
                    water of seas or oceans, or the brackish water of coastal estuaries. At a fundamental level, marine life affects the nature of the planet. Marine organisms, mostly microorganisms, produce oxygen and sequester carbon. Marine life in part shape and protect shorelines, and 
                    some marine organisms even help create new land (e.g., coral building reefs).
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most life forms began their evolution in aquatic environments. About 90% of the world's living space is 
                    provided by the oceans in terms of volume. Fish, which are only found in water, are the first known vertebrates. Some of these transformed into amphibians, which dwell both on land and in water for parts of the day. A few subgroups of one group of amphibians, which also included sea turtles, seals, manatees, and whales, developed into reptiles and mammals. Some underwater habitats are supported by plant life that grows in the water, such as kelp and other algae. The base of the ocean food chain is made up 
                    primarily of phytoplankton, which are important primary producers.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Classification is a key tool for making decisions. However, due to a paucity of expertise and a high 
                    similarity index of traits, proper categorization remains a difficulty for some. The conventional morphological classification system was seen to be a tiresome, costly, and time- consuming process before the development of technology. It necessitates in-depth taxonomic knowledge and the experience of qualified taxonomists and 
                    technicians, whose numbers have steadily declined over time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The center and its researchers would benefit from the deployment of a neural network for automatic 
                    classification in their excursions and laboratory work. As a result, automating the classification process could improve classification accuracy, increase analytical scalability, and reduce costs. To perform sea animal classification Python is employed as a programming language Because it is compatible with the TensorFlow framework. The dataset consist of butterfly, dragonfly, grasshopper, ladybird, and mosquito sea animals are used to classify. To perform sea animal classification by using a python programming language. Because it is compatible with the TensorFlow framework. python is the most developed in machine learning. The input data primarily concentrates on the sea animal category with five different types of sea animals included in the dataset. CNN was chosen as the best alternative for the training procedures. Because it delivered a high percentage of accuracy. The system will be pre-loaded with thousands of input data to make the ‘training’ session more efficient and effective. The primary goal of image classification is to ensure that all images are classified into their respective sector and groups. Each percentage 
                    of ‘train’ sessions will be tested and validated for better accuracy.

   <center> <h1>System Specification</h1> </center>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A system requirements specification is normally produced in response to a user requirements specification or other expressions of requirements and is then used as the basis for system design. The system requirements specification typically differs from the expression of requirements in both scope and precisions then later it may cover both the envisaged system and the environment in which it will operate but may leave many broad concepts unrefined. Traditionally, system requirements and specifications tool the form of natural-language documents.</p>

            <h2>1.1 Hardware Requirements</h2>
            <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The required system configuration for software development and software implementation is as follows. Hardware specifications of the system that is used in the project are,</p>

       <h3>System study is classified into two types</h3> 
        <ul><li>Existing system</li>  
	        <li>Proposed system </li>
    </p>
    <h2>2.3 Existing System :</h2>
        <p>
            In the existing concept if  anyone patient got injured want to take a scan and visit the for away/near by hospital .
            In that case it is not safe for the patient to travel with the pain.
            Sometime the doctors may not present at the hospital , due to that they may want to visit another hospital or come back to home with pain without any solution for that pain. Even Some times their won’t be any proper treatments and proper instruction.
            And Sometime doctors may not answer our queries. 
        </p>
    <h2>2.4 Proposed System : </h2>
    <p>
        In the proposed system the user can use this application to know their report result with short time interval .
         The user want to register their name and an id will be given to them . 
         By using their id they can login to submit their scanned report . 
         Once the report is submitted the report get scanned and move on to the doctors view point . 
         Then the user can view the doctor  to know their problem in their knee . 
         The doctors also provide proper medicine and tips to recover their pain and come  back to normal form.
         User may have some doubt about their description  and they can text queries and get the proper answer from the doctors.

        <h3>Interpretation of Results</h3>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The result of the model is found using the accuracy and loss generated by our model for both the training and validation sets and comparing them to each other. The loss of a model is the sum of the differences between the actual values and the predicted values, whereas the accuracy tells us how many of the data points we correctly classified. This helps interpretability in the sense of showing us what the problem in our model is in four ways
            
            <ul>
                <li>High loss, low accuracy — we are making big errors on large proportion of data</li>
                <li>High loss, high accuracy — we are making big errors on a small proportion of data</li>
                <li>Low loss, low accuracy — we are making small errors on a large proportion of data </li>
                <li>Low loss, high accuracy — we are making small errors on small proportion of data</li>

         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There have been many studies and experiments done on sea animal classification using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Overall, CNNs have proven to be highly effective in accurately identifying and classifying different species of sea animals based on their images.One study published in the Journal of Marine Science and Engineering used a CNN to classify six different species of sea animals: dolphin, fish, jellyfish, octopus, sea turtle, and shark. The researchers used a dataset of 5,000 images, which was split into training and testing sets. They achieved an accuracy of 95.9% on the testing set, which is a highly accurate result.</p>
         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another study published in the Journal of Marine Science and Engineering used a CNN to classify five different species of sea turtles: green turtle, hawksbill turtle, leatherback turtle, loggerhead turtle, and olive ridley turtle. The researchers used a dataset of 600 images, which was also split into training and testing sets. They achieved an accuracy of 94.5% on the testing set, which is also highly accurate.</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One of the most popular Deep Neural networks is Convolutional Neural Network. It is commonly applied to analyze visual imagery. In this paper, deep neural networks are used for  sea animal classification based on CNN. There are five classes are used in the sea animal dataset. The images were preprocessed by using Image Data Generator. Forgetting a large amount of data, we used the Data Augmentation Technique. The Convolutional Neural Network is created input layer, a hidden layer with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, a fully connected layer and an output layer for classification.
        <p>Sea animal classification is the categorizing of sea animals and organisms hierarchically. Sea animal classification is based on an organism decent from a common ancestor. Accordingly, the most important traits for classification are those inherited from a common ancestor. There are a lot of glitches essential to be measured in emerging an animal classification algorithm. Primary is the illumination problem, in which an unexpected change of illumination result typically in interior request can affect the efficiency in noticing the attendance of animal interruption.</p>
        <p> Also, luminance problematic with vicissitudes of usual setting from day to night at outside shadowing system can also touch the detection. Also, affecting background, such as greeneries by breeze strength be stared as forefront image and some sedentary animal which continue still for an extended time can be incorrectly understood as contextual image by the algorithms.</p>
        <p>There are lots of problems that essential to be taken into account for developing an efficient animal discovery algorithm. Animals originate from nowhere so we can’t forecast their occurrence and also the rapidity of the animals can’t be checked or noticed. The features are extracted from the convolutional and pooling layer and they are flattened together at the fully connected layers. The dataset was modeled 75% for training and 25% for validation. The sea animal dataset accuracy was 79%.
